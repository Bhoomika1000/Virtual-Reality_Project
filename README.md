🧠 Narnia's Escape & 🪂 Parachute Drop Simulation Projects 
This repository contains two immersive interactive graphics projects:

Narnia's Escape – A Unity-based VR puzzle adventure

Parachute Drop Simulation – A 2D OpenGL & GLUT animated environment

📁 Project 1: Narnia’s Escape – A Unity Puzzle Adventure
🧙 Description:
Narnia’s Escape is a fantasy-inspired first-person puzzle game developed in Unity. The player begins in a tranquil mystical forest and is transported to a locked escape room. To win, the player must solve a series of logic-based and physics-based puzzles to open the final door and return home.

🔧 Features:
- First-person movement and mouse-look camera controls

- Scene transitions between forest and room using triggers

- Interactive button sequence puzzle

- Physics-based throwing puzzle (crystal ball)

- Animated door that opens upon puzzle completion

- Custom lighting and effects for key objects

- Built using Unity Asset Store models and ProBuilder geometry

- Clean code with OnMouseDown(), Raycasting, SceneManager, and Coroutines

🧩 Gameplay Flow:

- The Mystical Forest – Player spawns and explores to find a large tree tunnel.

- Teleportation – Entering the tree teleports the player to an escape room.

- Puzzle 1 – Press a series of buttons in the correct order.

- Puzzle 2 – Grab the glowing crystal ball and throw it at the door.

- Escape – If the throw has enough force, the door opens and the game ends.

📁 Project 2: Parachute Drop Simulation (OpenGL & GLUT)

🌤 Description:

An animated 2D parachute drop simulation using OpenGL and GLUT, showcasing realistic physics like gravity, wind drift, parachute collapse, and post-landing animation. The scenery is alive with butterflies, trees, clouds, and sun animations.

🔧 Features:

i) Physics-driven vertical fall with gravity and landing drag

ii) Horizontal drift based on wind strength

iii) Swaying parachute animation

iv) Realistic parachute collapse and detachment

v) Running animation after landing

vi) Moving clouds and flying butterflies

vii) Scenic ground layers with hills, trees, flowers, and sky

viii) Wind strength adjustable via keyboard

ix) Reset animation anytime
